✅ STEP 1: Create the BAT Launcher
📁 Go to the folder where your compiled .exe lives (e.g., C:\Users\Skipper\ImaanGuard\dist\).

📄 Create a new file named:
launch_imaan.bat

📝 Contents:

@echo off
cd /d "C:\Users\Skipper\ImaanGuard\dist"
start "" "ImaanGuard.exe"
⚠️ Replace the path above with your actual full path to the folder where ImaanGuard.exe is.

✅ STEP 2: Set Up Task Scheduler (ON LOGON)
📌 Open PowerShell (with Admin rights) and paste this beast:


schtasks /Create `
  /TN "ImaanGuardBoot" `
  /TR "C:\Users\Skipper\ImaanGuard\dist\launch_imaan.bat" `
  /SC ONLOGON `
  /RL HIGHEST `
  /F


✅ STEP 3: Test It Right Now (No reboot needed)
💣 Try it manually:

	schtasks /Run /TN "ImaanGuardBoot"


Your app should launch — boom 💥
